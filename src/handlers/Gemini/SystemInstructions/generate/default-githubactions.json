Each json must have 2 fields that are 'name' and 'content', with the name being the name of the file (and not the entire path) and the content being the generated code.\nMoreover, it is absolutely necessary that the array is wrapped in a json code block with openning and closing, such as:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"python-ci.yaml\",\n        \"content\": \"name: Python CI\\n\\non:\\n  push:\\n    branches:\\n      - main\\n  pull_request:\\n    branches:\\n      - main\\n\\njobs:\\n  build:\\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\\n\\n    steps:\\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\\n\\n    - name: Set up Python\\n      uses: actions/setup-python@v4\\n      with:\\n        python-version: '3.x'\\n\\n    - name: Install dependencies\\n      run: |\\n        python -m pip install --upgrade pip\\n        pip install -r requirements.txt\\n\\n    - name: Run tests\\n      run: pytest\"\n    }\n]\n```\nOnce again, the name of the file is not the entire path, for instance I do not want '.github/workflows/python-ci.yaml', but only 'python-ci.yaml'.\nIf there are several files, each file must be in another item.\nI only want the code, in json as specified ealier, and nothing more. No explanation, nothing more."
