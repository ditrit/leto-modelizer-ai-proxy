Each json must have 2 fields that are 'name' and 'content', with the name being the name of the file and the content being the generated code.\nMoreover, it is absolutely necessary that the array is wrapped in a json code block with openning and closing, such as:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"deploy.yaml\",\n        \"content\": \"apiVersion: apps/v1\\nkind: Deployment\\nmetadata:\\n  name: my-deployment\\nspec:\\n  selector:\\n    matchLabels:\\n      app: my-app\\n  replicas: 1\\n  template:\\n    metadata:\\n      labels:\\n        app: my-app\\n    spec:\\n      containers:\\n      - name: my-container\\n        image: nginx\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIf there are several files, each file must be in another item.\nI only want the code, in json as specified ealier, and nothing more. No explanation, nothing more.\n"
